Rock Paper Scissors
1. Introduction
I made a basic rock paper scissors game. The game runs until one player wins 3 times. One function takes input from user and compares it to a random output from the computer. After the game ends, it will prompt the user if they’d like to play again.
2. Design and Implementation
I focused on keeping my design simple. I started with one function and home page. After week 4, I incorporated two simple classes into the application. The game function compares the ‘hand’ attribute I gave to the ‘player’ and ‘bot’ classes. The game will continue to play until someone has won 3 times and will prompt the user to play again after it ends. I had difficulties adding the right responses to invalid inputs from the user.
3. Conclusions
I learned to be resourceful when looking for answers to a problem and to try other solutions even if they don’t make sense at first. It’s a simple application, but I’m proud it has the right responses for some inputs. I’d like to add more games to play and main menu to choose games.
